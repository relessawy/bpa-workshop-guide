# Use Case Overview

In this workshop we will create a Procurement process that manages the process of ordering a new asset like a phone or laptop.

    - The process is triggered when an employee requests an asset
    - The Procurement department creates an order request
    - The Supplier then sends an offer stating its best offer
    - The urgency of the order determines the tolerance for price, obviously orders of high urgency have a higher price tolerance
    - Depending on the urgency of the order and the price, the order can be auto-approved by a decision in the process
    - If the order can not be auto-approved, a purchasing manager needs to complete a manual approval step
