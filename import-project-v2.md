# Import project (5 mins)

To define and deploy a business process, we first need to have a project in which we can store all the project assets. Assets like the data model, processes, rules and the forms required for user interaction. Projects allow multiple users to collaborate and work together on the same assets while controlling the level of access for each user.

## To import a  project

- Navigate to **Business Central** (URL provided by your instructor in the etherpad)
- Login using the following credentials
    - `pamAdmin`
    - `redhatpam1!`
- Once you login to **Business Central**, you are greeted with 4 groups of functionalities as shown in the following screen
- Right now we want to start designing our process, so click on **Design** to navigate to the **Design perspective**

![Business Central]({% image_path m1p5i1_businesscentral.png %}){:width="600px”}

- Click on **MySpace** to enter the default space

![MySpace]({% image_path m1p5i2_MySpace.png %}){:width="600px”}

- You’ve entered **MySpace**, initially this is empty
- Right now there are no projects in your space. You can either 
    - create a new project 
    - import an existing one
    - or try one of the ready samples
- Let’s go ahead and import a project, click on the **Import Project** button

![AddProject]({% image_path m1p5i3_AddProject.png %}){:width="600px”}

- In the **Repository URL** filed provide the following URL: https://github.com/relessawy/procurement-process
- Click on the **Import** button
- Now click on the **procurment-process** tile to select it, then click on the **Ok** button to the top right
    
![ImportProject]({% image_path ImportProject.png %}){:width="600px”}



- It may take a few minutes for the project to be fully loaded, you will see this screen as **RH PAM** organizes the imported assests

![IndexingProject]({% image_path IndexingProject.png %}){:width="600px”}

- Your project is now ready to start modelling the different assets of your process, in the next exercise we will start by creating our data model
- Go ahead an mark **Exercise 1 Import Porject** as complete for your user in the googles sheet.
