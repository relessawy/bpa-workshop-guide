# Create a new project (5 mins)

To define and deploy a business process, we first need to create a new project in which we can store all the project assets. Assets like the data model, processes, rules and the forms required for user interaction. Projects allow multiple users to collaborate and work together on the same assets while controlling the level of access for each user.

## To create a new project

- Navigate to **Business Central** (URL provided by your instructor)
- Login using the following credentials
    - `pamAdmin`
    - `redhatpam1!`
- Once you login to **Business Central**, you are greeted with 4 groups of functionalities as shown in the following screen
- Right now we want to start designing our process, so click on **Design** to navigate to the **Design perspective**

![Business Central]({% image_path m1p5i1_businesscentral.png %}){:width="600px”}

- Click on **MySpace** to enter the default space

![MySpace]({% image_path m1p5i2_MySpace.png %}){:width="600px”}

- You’ve entered **MySpace**, initially this is empty
- Right now there are no projects in your space. You can either 
    - create a new project 
    - import an existing one
    - or try one of the ready samples
- Let’s go ahead and create a new project, click on the **Add Project** button

![AddProject]({% image_path m1p5i3_AddProject.png %}){:width="600px”}

- Fill in the project details as follows and then click the **Add** button
    - **Name**: procurement-process
    - **Description**: Procurement Process
    
![AddProject]({% image_path m1p5i5_AddProjectDialog.png %}){:width="600px”}

![Info]({% image_path m0_info.png %}){:align="left"} 

It is a common practice to link the words that make up a project name with hyphens instead of spaces, as done in this case. Using spaces will create invalid file names.

---

- An empty Assets view is displayed for the project
- Note the buttons in the middle of the page, these allow you to add or import assets to the project. We will start adding assets in the next section of the workshop.
